/**
 * Demonstration of how to customize rendering based on whether
 * or not the table is being printed. The last column of the table,
 * the "Passed" column, is given an extended version of TablePrintDemo1's
 * PassedColumnRenderer, which uses clearer black and white versions
 * of the check mark and x mark icons when printing, as determined by
 * calling isPaintingForPrint on the table.
 * <p>
 * Requires the following other files:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>TablePrintDemo1.java
 *     <li>images/passed.png
 *     <li>images/failed.png
 *     <li>images/passed-BW.png
